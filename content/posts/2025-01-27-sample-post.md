# Sample Self-Sourced Blog Post

This is a **sample blog post** to demonstrate the posts collection in Keystatic. Unlike news articles that link to external press releases, blog posts contain original content written by AlphaTON Capital.

## What Makes Posts Different

Blog posts in the posts collection:
- Contain full article content (not just excerpts)
- Are self-sourced (not linked to PR sources)
- Can have featured images
- Support rich formatting with Markdown/Markdoc

## Getting Started with Posts

To create a new blog post:

1. Go to `/keystatic` in your browser
2. Click "Blog Posts" → "Create entry"
3. Fill in:
   - **Title**: Your post title
   - **Date**: Publication date
   - **Excerpt**: Short description (appears in listings)
   - **Content**: Full article content (rich text editor)
   - **Featured Image**: Optional image
   - **Published**: Check to make it visible

4. Click "Save"

The post will be saved as a Markdown file in `content/posts/` and will be accessible at `/posts/[slug]`.

## Example Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and [links](https://alphatoncapital.com).

### Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Code

You can also include code snippets:

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, AlphaTON Capital!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Posts are a great way to share original insights, company updates, and detailed articles that don't fit the news format.
